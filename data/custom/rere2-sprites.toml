#     Tile format:
#         baba = { sprite = "baba", color = [ 0, 3 ], tiling = 2 } 
#     Please do not use multiline tables, as it will cause merge conflicts with Git. 
# 
#     Note: If your tile has tiling type 1,
#           you must add the "diagonal = true/false" attribute to the tile
#           in order for it to pass CI.
#           For example, "line" = { ..., diagonal = false }.

rеrе2 = {sprite = "rеrе2", color = [0, 3], tiling = -1}
#     The above line is not a real sprite and is to be removed if another sprite is added.
